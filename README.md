# LP Solver

This is a simple linear programming solver written in python.  The objective is to be essentially compatible with GLPK input, but have workings that I understand and can play with to learn more about the mechanics of solving MILP problems.

## Input Format
The solver reads CPLEX LP format files, according to this guide: http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.0/CPLEX-format.htm
